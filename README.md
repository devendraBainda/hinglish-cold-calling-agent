## üìù Notes on Hinglish Handling

The system is designed to handle Hinglish speech, which is a mix of Hindi and English commonly used in India. The speech recognition and synthesis are configured for this hybrid language pattern, using the `hi-IN` language code which provides good support for Hinglish.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### PyAudio Installation Issues

If you encounter installation problems with PyAudio on Windows:
1. Download the appropriate wheel file from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
2. Install the wheel file directly:
   ```bash
   pip install [path-to-wheel-file].whl
   ```

### Speech Recognition Problems

If the system fails to recognize speech:
- Check your microphone settings
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Try speaking more clearly and at a moderate pace
- Adjust ambient noise with `recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source, duration=1)`

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys and sensitive information should be stored in environment variables or secure configuration files
- The service account used for Google Calendar should have minimal permissions
- Customer data should be handled according to relevant privacy regulations
